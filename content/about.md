# Hi there! ðŸŒŠ

My name is John. I'm an engineer VP at The Linux Foundation
where I'm building our AI and backend infrastructure for the LFX platform.

In the past, I've worked at OpenSauced, AWS, VMware, & Pivotal Cloud Foundry
where I worked on open source software, observability & SRE tooling, Kubernetes, Linux operating systems, and cloud technologies.

This site is my personal landing page and blog.
You'll find all kinds of stuff here: stuff about tech, short stories, long-form essays,
photos, music, videos, ramblings on philosophy, and really, whatever I want _(it's my website after all)_.

All opinions and views herein are my _own_ opinions and do _not_ reflect
those of any employer (past, present, future, or inter-dimensional).

Enjoy!
