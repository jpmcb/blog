# Hi there! ðŸŒŠ

My name is John & I'm a software engineer at Amazon Web Services
where I work on open source software, Kubernetes, Linux operating systems, and cloud technologies.

This site is my personal landing page and blog.
You'll find all kinds of stuff here: stuff about tech, short stories,
photos, videos, ramblings on philosophy, and really, whatever I want.

For my long-form essays on software engineering and the tech industry,
[subscribe to my substack, On Engineering.](https://onengineering.substack.com/)

All opinions and views herein are my _own_ opinions and do _not_ reflect
those of any employer (past, present, future, or inter-dimensional).

Enjoy!
