# Hi there! ðŸŒŠ

My name is John & I'm a senior software engineer at [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza)
where I'm building open source insights tooling.

In the past, I've worked at AWS, VMware, & Pivotal Cloud Foundry
where I worked on open source software, Kubernetes, Linux operating systems, and cloud technologies.

This site is my personal landing page and blog.
You'll find all kinds of stuff here: stuff about tech, short stories, long-form essays,
photos, videos, ramblings on philosophy, and really, whatever I want _(it's my website after all)_.

All opinions and views herein are my _own_ opinions and do _not_ reflect
those of any employer (past, present, future, or inter-dimensional).

Enjoy!
