Before I became a programmer, I was a registered nurse.

---

### The ugly parts (bitten, spat at)

---

### 3 days to say "I love you man" (and a long drive home)

---

### Morning breakfast burritos

### One of the best days of my life

I'll never forget the day I walked into my managers office,
told him I was quiting,
and never looked back.
He was shocked, to say the least.

What makes life worth living?
Often, during the middle of a night shift, I'd find myself asking that question.
Many of the old, dying patients around me had accomplished very little,
family and friends were long gone,
etc.

It was the little moments.
Always the little moments that made it all worth it.
A passing smile to impart some comfort,
tears at realizing this fleeting moment would be your last together,
or that morning breakfast burritos smothered in chili sauce after a long night in the hospital.

I do not miss my nursing career.
But, at times, I do miss the many small moments and all the lessons about life to be learned along the way.
