title: "How the Agile Manifesto Changed Nothing"

When the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
first appeared in 2001, the industry had just finished
reeling from the catastrophic collapse of the dot-com bubble. Massive amounts of
capital had swarmed into the tech market, every company was “adopting” the
internet, and, when the inevitable economic downturn arrived, many software
engineers lost their jobs. 

Flush with cash due to the low interest rates of 1998 and 1999, the late 90s
gave rise to a new kind of startup: _the internet startup_. Blinded by the
possibilities of this entirely new and booming market, many entrepreneurs (often
without the ability to actually execute on their ideas) where able to
successfully pitch their businesses to venture firms. While there were some
massively successful unicorns that came out of this bubble (like Google’s
internet search engine, Ebay’s online auction site, and Amazon.com’s internet
book store) many others failed, inevitably going out of business and tanking the
market with them.

Regardless of this terrible tech-market, the world of software in 2001 was a
very messy, cut-throat, and “process-heavy” place. Many engineers were subject
to the dreadful Waterfall methodologies of software development: a system of
creating software that used ironclad requirements which were very difficult to
change. And fixed deadlines on delivery of software products left little room
for iteration or integration testing. 

In other engineering fields, Waterfall works just fine: if you’re building a
bridge, I sure hope you have a list of requirements, measurements, materials,
and structural calculations before you start building.

But in software, where things change quickly, integrations break often, and
customer needs shift without warning, a shorter and simpler development
methodology is often needed. You could be months into developing some piece of
software using Waterfall and find out some critical API integration being
delivered by another team, in another department is completely incompatible with
what you’ve built (requiring more lengthy Waterfall cycles). Or that your
project is getting de-prioritized, if not canceled completely, by the business
(if only we had gotten user feedback months ago so we knew what the right thing
to build was … ).

Companies in the late 90s and early 2000s that attempted to “adopt the internet”
found themselves bogged down by the old lengthy engineering processes and dev
cycles. This, at least in part, contributed to the economic collapse of the
dot-com bubble: huge sectors of the economy that had stagnated and failed to
execute on inflated evaluations of their internet business’s value and
stability. I wonder what the world would be like if businesses during the early
technology revolutions had taken the simpler agile approach: would fewer
businesses have failed? Would we have progressed the state of technology even
further today?

Thankfully, agile proposes a different approach.

Let’s imagine your team is tasked with building and delivering a software car.
In Waterfall development, you might first build the frame, then the wheels,
eventually the engine, and so on. Alot can go wrong: what if your customers
needs aren’t met by the final product? What if your integrations with the road
software suite is broken upon delivery? Or you find out that the engine
components never actually worked as intended causing the entire product to
break. The plans and requirements for the car are handed down to the dev team at
the very beginning of development, often by “the business”, and there is little
flexibility for change or ability to get early feedback from real users.

Conversely, using agile to build this software car, you’d always and
continuously deliver working and tested software, working closely with the
people who know the customer’s needs. You might first deliver a skateboard type
thing. Easy enough to build; it has four wheels and works right out of the gate.
Then, you may make the frame bigger. You may add an engine for a small
go-cart-type vehicle. Add enough seats for a car. Configure the steering wheel.
Add a radio. Eventually, the project will be completed and, all along the way,
the development team is able to get feedback from real users and integrate with
existing systems continuously, testing as they go (the team would catch that
failing integration with the road systems very early on!).

Agile software development proposes principles that may seem obvious to
engineers today in 2023, but, at the time, these ideas were intriguing, nuanced,
and powerful: always deliver working software, test your code, integrate
continuously, have face-to-face conversations, prioritize relationships with
people on your team, adapt quickly to changing requirements, work closely with
the business people, and let teams self organize for the best results.

Like any good “declaration”, all this was wrapped up in a simple and elegant
document: The Agile Manifesto. This wasn’t something that was handed down from
pundits within the industry; it was written and signed by software engineers
doing real work. Its inception actually sounds like something out of a novel: in
the winter of 2001, 17 software developers gathered in Snowbird Utah to ski,
eat, drink, and discuss the software industry (but, unfortunately, not to go on
some epic quest). People like Kent Beck (who would later go on to establish
Extreme programming), Andrew Hunt & David Thomas (who co-authored The Pragmatic
Programmer), and Jeff Sutherland (a fore-father of the scrum project management
methods). They were all present. The output; a single, simple document outlining
the engineering processes for an ideal, lean, and efficient software
organization.

Agile development would eventually become the bedrock for other systems of
software development, like Scrum, DevOps, Extreme-programming, and Platform
Engineering. These subsequent systems of development heavily emphasized
different prinviples within agile; like continuous delivery, continuous
integration automation suites, relationships between individual contributors,
and easily deploying and delivering optimized dev environments to individual
contributors and dev teams. But throughout all of these methodologies is agile.
Agile remains the backbone. Agile is what gave life to these methods.

Despite agile seeming like it’s all about process and how to get stuff done, the
Agile Manifesto is, first and foremost, a response to an industry that was
falling apart, cannibalizing itself from the inside out, and burning out its
talent. 

At its heart, [The Agile Manifesto is](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html):

> … a set of values based on trust and respect for each other and promoting
> organizational models based on people, collaboration, and building the types of
> organizational communities in which we would want to work.

To buy into the agile engineering processes also means that you buy into the
cultural ideals that surround and encompass agile. The engineering processes of
test often, ship working code, integrate continuously, etc. are only in service
of a model that supports the kinds of engineering organizations where
self-organizing teams thrive, people love the work they are doing, and trust in
your fellow engineer is paramount.

Today, most software organizations would say they’ve adopted agile (or at least
some bastardized form of agile). Yet, I would argue that the industry has missed
the mark on adopting the true heart of agile.

We find ourselves in a very similar situation to the 2001 dot-com bubble
collapse; increasing interest rates, massive droves of software talent being let
go [in some of the worst ways possible](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-employee-layoffs-engineer-locked-out-emails-termination-pichai-2023-1),
priorities shifting away from collaboration and psychologically safe engineering organizations and moving more
towards efficiently delivering products.

It seems that the industry is pushing back on the agile ideals.

And my worst fear is that the Agile Manifesto changed nothing with more and more
of the sector being somewhere I wouldn’t really want to work.

I’ll be the first to admit: agile takes time, energy, and dedication. It’s not
always easy. Retrospectives, planning meetings, user research (and so on) all
take time and engineering resources. Time not spent coding or working directly
on products. But if there’s anything the last 20 some years of this tech boom
market have shown us, where agile was adopted by the industry very broadly, it’s
that agile works. Happy engineers who love their work deliver amazing solutions
and, in the long term, make for more sustainable organizations that can continue
to ship stable, and innovative products that customers love.

If you’ve been reading this so far and find yourself saying “Huh, the dot-com
bubble sort of looks like the tech-market today”, that’s because it is. From an
economic standpoint, culture perspective, and engineering process view. It seems
when the economic goings get rough, engineering organizations get worse.

A primary, high profile example of this is the Elon Musk takeover of Twitter:
most engineers have been laid off, there have been
[multiple lengthy outages](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/08/spike-in-twitter-outages-since-musk-takeover-hint-at-more-systemic-problems),
[rumors of badly broken internal infrastructure systems](https://twitter.com/davidgerard/status/1634633886712954881),
and a new [“extremely hardcore” culture](https://www.theverge.com/23551060/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-layoffs-workplace-salute-emoji),
all for the crusade to find profitability and ship software requirements.

But Elon is not solely to blame.
[The problems at Twitter existed long before the takeover](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/technology/twitter-culture-change-conflict.html?searchResultPosition=1):

> Soon after joining Twitter in 2019, Dantley Davis gathered his staff in a
> conference room at the company’s San Francisco headquarters … He asked employees
> to go around the room, complimenting and critiquing one another. Tough criticism
> would help Twitter improve, he said. The barbs soon flew. Several attendees
> cried during the two-hour meeting, said three people who were there.

That sure doesn’t sound like _“the type of organizational community in which we
would want to work”_.

This is significant because the tech market is a self feeding, always
cannibalizing beast: whatever the big players do, typically companies like
Google, Meta, and Amazon, the rest of the tech market will follow. These trends
in engineering cultures, compensation, interviews, and so on will always trickle
down to the rest of the industry. So, without you even knowing it, the Elon
takeover of Twitter has probably already affected you.

Layoffs and downsizing in 2023 may not yet be over. [And many economists believe](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/business/economy-markets-recession-federal-reserve.html)
we are heading into a recession (if not already there) which could accelerate
cultural and engineering organization changes at many companies. And like
before, in 2001, when the dot-com bubble had its reckoning, the software and
tech industry of today must face the economic music.

But my hope for the future is that engineering organizations and leadership
recognize the history that is being repeated here, change course, and continue
to focus on lean, agile processes that work for them. Otherwise, we may see more
companies like Twitter with a failing business model, collapsing infrastructure,
deplorable stability, and maybe worst of all, an engineering organization that
no one wants to be apart of.
