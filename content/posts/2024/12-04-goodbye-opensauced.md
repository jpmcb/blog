Now that the acquisition dust has settled
and I've started to find my footing at The Linux Foundation,
I wanted to take a moment to reflect, think back on the
last year and a half of building OpenSauced,
ponder the lessons learned, and take a moment to thank everyone who made this journey
possible.

And ultimately, what is a company but the people that make up the greater whole?

I found myself at OpenSauced doing some of my most inspired and inventive work
(often on a shoestring budget, under tight _"startup mode"_ deadlines).
I attribute all that innovation to nothing but the vision laid out by the people that surrounded us
and made up the engineering org.

If I had to give one piece of advice to prospective startup founders or early engineers,
it'd be to encapsulate yourself with people
who challenge you, inspire you, accept you, are ready to be challenged,
and have a vision for the future you resonate with.
_And then let them go out, do their job, and excel._
Too often we forget the _human side_ of building tech and it can be easy to get stuck in _"founder mode"_ grind
where the sole focus is _what_ you're building (not _how_ or _why_).

Bootstrapping a company often means building a place that talented people can call home.
A place they're excited to show up and do great work.
