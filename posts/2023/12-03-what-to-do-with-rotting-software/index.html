Well, the last update to the “package.json” was over a year ago, in August of 2022. There are 20 some odd Dependabot pull requests unaddressed. And a quick “npm audit” of the library shows 109 vulnerabilities; 1 low, 39 moderate, 51 high, and 18 critical (as of the time of this writing).\nThose familiar with contributing to open source software know this as project “rot”: when something goes unmaintained and accumulates cruft over time.\nWe recommend that you don’t raise issues or pull requests, as they will not be reviewed or actioned until further notice.\nOr in other words, this library still exists, is depended on by legitimate products, can be easily consumed via NPM, but is ostensively dead. A rotting, zombie library that may spread dangerous vulnerabilities to downstream consumers, unaware of the potential risks they’re bringing into their codebases and exposing to their customers.\nWhat should we do with libraries like react-beautiful-dnd?\n“Completely deprecate it, archiving in the process?” Atlassian, and often times many other big tech companies, simply can not do this nor afford it. There may be deep internal dependencies that could take months of engineering effort to move tools off of. There could still be products (and customers) with long support cycles that rely heavily on the libraries functionality for many years in the future.\nOr maybe the maintainers and teams that created the projects have moved on or left the company: the burden on the business to maintain open source software is often a neglected aspect of the FOSS movement. It can be very challenging to find the right engineering allocation for projects like this.\nDeprecating and removing open source projects can also backfire in really big ways: giving a long notice to the community that the project will officially end and no longer be made available after some point can be a massive disruption to dependent, downstream projects. The supply-chain rot will end and unknowing consumers of potentially critical vulnerabilities can choose something better, but you essentially shatter the chain of dependencies forcing those downstream projects to spend potentially critical engineering cycles on desperate efforts to update packages before a dependency vanishes. Or, in the worst cases, deprecation unknowingly break functionality for entire products, pipelines, and businesses.\nSoftware rarely exists in an isolated space: it almost always lives and breathes within an ecosystem. And deprecation can be an incredibly disruptive to that delicate, living balance.\n“Well, can’t they just maintain it then?” This is clearly an ideal solution for the software supply-chain and the wider software ecosystem, especially with existing business dependencies, but this may not be possible depending on engineering allocations, headcount, if the original creators are still at the company, interest within the engineering org, etc. For some companies, all this engineering overhead is simply off the table due to cost and prioritization.\n“Lift and shift to something else?” For most people consuming a library like react-beautiful-dnd, this seems to be the best choice: there are many drop in replacements that work well, like dnd-kit. But it might not be that simple: what if there are custom patches that you rely on that have not yet been upstreamed? What if drop in replacements aren’t truly “drop in” and require more work to pass tests and product requirements?\n“Ok, I really need this one though. Fork it?” Another excellent choice, but a costly one: in and of itself, forking comes with alot of engineering overhead. To fork and maintain a large React component library is not a trivial task. But that’s sort of the beauty of open source software: if you or your business really depend on this library, given that the license is permissive enough, you can always fork the project, fix it, or enhance it in any way you see fit.\n“If they can’t maintain it, forking requires too much overhead, and deprecating is too disruptive, just leave it as is and let it rot?”\nThis seems to be the only unfortunate choice left to leadership of many engineering orgs. It’s a sort of “between a rock and a hard place” decision. And I personally don’t think this is necessarily a bad choice: all software has a lifecycle and is inevitably destined to be re-written. Even the original creator of the react-beautiful-dnd library agrees:\nOver time I am more comfortable with the notion that all software has a shelf life and that it’s okay for open source maintainers to discontinue working on projects if they choose to\nI deeply empathize with any open source maintainers that face such a decision: it’s not easy to find yourself with new priorities, reduced headcount, or tricky dependency chains.\nThe provenance and stability of open source software within the secure software supply-chain is an incredibly complex topic. And, in my opinion, is still relatively unsolved today.\nHaving a deep understanding of where your software dependencies come from and what’s happening in the ecosystem around the bits you need is a critical first step. Supporting and sponsoring open source maintainers is a great second step. And, as a triumphant step across the finish line, allocate engineering resources into projects you or your business depend on.\n","wordCount":"1002","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-12-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-12-03T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://johncodes.com/posts/2023/12-03-what-to-do-with-rotting-software/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"John McBride","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://johncodes.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://johncodes.com/ accesskey=h title="John McBride (Alt + H)">John McBride</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/archives title=Writing><span>Writing</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/index.xml title=RSS><span>RSS</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/talks/ title=Talks><span>Talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What to do with rotting software?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-12-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 3, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>If you were to visit one of the biggest React drag and drop libraries on GitHub,
