I lead rock climbing trips, rafted rivers, hiked 14-ers, and bushwacked in the backcountry. And like this story from Krista Diamond reflects on, I too faced unprecedented life or death situations in the backcountry. But too often, time and time again, I would brush off my experiance as\nWe as humans are very bad at assessing risk. People don’t conceptualize statistics, especially when it pertains to them personally. Whether it’s the risk of weather on the mountain or the risk of missing delivery deadlines at work, people don’t really understand the risk until it’s usually too late.\nOne of the best ways to combat this in my own life and work is to make the risk more digestible and specific: “The backcountry is dangerous and risky” is difficult to conceptualize. But “crossing a river at peak flow while wearing your pack is dangerous and risky” is way easier to reason about. “Re-writing the entire app is risky” is difficult to conceptualize. But “re-writing the app to use a newest web framework would require we adopt a new database schema which entails doing risky and costly migrations” is easier to reason about.\nJeff Beck, Guitarist With a Chapter in Rock History, Dies at 78 - The New York Times When I was 12, I got my first guitar. I always wanted to play like my dad and my big brother. I learned the basics from my dad but then (like any teenager would), I wanted to find my own path. I would go to the local library, browse their collection of CDs, find albums with interesting enough covers, and check them out. I’d then head home, put the CD into my disc changer, pick up my guitar, and try my best to play along.\nI stumbled onto Jeff Beck’s Wired album, put it on, and was immediately introduced to Led Boots:\nI’d never heard anything like it; a mix of sweeping rock solos, complex jazz changes, nuanced beats, \u0026 a mixing of melody and rythmn.\nI went back to the library and I checked out ever Jeff Beck album they had.

And sometimes, you need to escape using an alias in favor of its original intent. A good example in my environment is:\n$ which vim vim: aliased to nvim $ vim --version NVIM v0.8.2 I use NeoVim almost exclusively so the “vim” alias makes sense 99% of the time. But whenever I need actual vim, I can escape my alias using a backslash:\n$ \\vim --version VIM - Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Nov 24 2016 16:44:48) This (unfortunately) won’t work on fish but is a great little backdoor alias escape for zsh, bash, etc.\n","wordCount":"760","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-15T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://johncodes.com/posts/2023/01-14-sat-edition/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"John McBride","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://johncodes.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://johncodes.com/ accesskey=h title="John McBride (Alt + H)">John McBride</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/archives title=Writing><span>Writing</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/index.xml title=RSS><span>RSS</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/talks/ title=Talks><span>Talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://johncodes.com/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">So long windows 7!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 15, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Welcome to the <em>&ldquo;Sunday Edition&rdquo;</em> of my blog.
