If you&rsquo;re interested in a video version of this post, check out the following from my YouTube.
In January of this year, 2023, I made the decision to delete my TikTok account; an account with over 135,000 followers, millions of likes, hundreds of videos, and countless comments. The “John Codes” page on TikTok is no more.
This was not a decision I came to lightly; there is “no turning back” from this."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://johncodes.com/posts/drafts/tiktok/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.3613efbd0b1772781e8f49935e973cae632a7f61471c05b17be155505ccf87b5.css integrity="sha256-NhPvvQsXcngej0mTXpc8rmMqf2FHHAWxe+FVUFzPh7U=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.f413e19d0714851f6474e7ee9632408e58ac146fbdbe62747134bea2fa3415e0.js integrity="sha256-9BPhnQcUhR9kdOfuljJAjlisFG+9vmJ0cTS+ovo0FeA=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
